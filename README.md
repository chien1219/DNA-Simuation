# DNA #  
DNA Simulation and interaction project that we have done with Unity3D in the Independent study in NCTU.  
Approved by MOST Academic Research Program in 2017 in Taiwan.
  
 ## Abstract  
   
Since DNA had been discovered in 1953, researches in DNA had become prosperous in various fields, therefore an indispensable knowledge in textbook. However, the presentation and introduction of DNA in its model or reaction has long being restricted to words or simple picture in the textbook, it is hard to thoroughly realize its structure by only narration. Thus, we try to put Virtual Reality into practice, combining headset and wearing devices, and make DNA clearly presented to boost efficiency in learning DNA. In the way to fulfill this goal, we created a double-helix DNA model by Unity 3D, marked the primary elements, and made it possible for users to interact with molecular elements so that they could realize components inside DNA. If we could apply this system to education, it would be more specific and intelligible for users in learning DNA.
